# IMDB Sample Database - Docker Setup

This Docker Compose setup creates a MySQL database with the IMDB sample database schema and data automatically loaded.

The IMDb database models the entertainment industry with comprehensive information about movies, TV shows, and the talent behind them. It covers titles across different content types and genres, cast and crew assignments with their specific roles, alternative regional titles and languages, episode structures for TV series, and production regions. The data supports film research, recommendation systems, and entertainment analytics.

## Files

- `docker-compose.yml` - Docker Compose configuration
- `imdb-schema.sql` - Database schema adapted from [1]
- `csv-data/` - Directory containing CSV data files for all tables [1]
- `model.png' - Entity-Relationship Diagram of the IMDB database [2]

This database uses sampled data from the IMDB non-commercial datasets.
Data files are located in the `csv-data/` directory.
